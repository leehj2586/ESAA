it was fine .\\n29

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

minutes .\\n63

problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n66

for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n70

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

                                             On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .\\n75

that I had ordered .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .\\n78

                                       Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of

above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast

                                 However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority

minutes .\\n63

problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n66

for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n70

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

                                       Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of

above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast

contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem

                                                 It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34

               It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

                                 I own XP Professional and wanted a nice, clean install of Win7 so I didn't have a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .\\n113

our long day at which I was told to go into the restaurant and ask the waiting staff myself and take it up to my room myself !\\n38

bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had several problems .\\n56

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

                                       The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

.\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

                      The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

                                                                                                                                                                                         It gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                             The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5

.\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9

whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12

get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

of paper .\\n15

                                    Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\n17

would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .\\n18

.\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions were easy to see and understand .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n41   My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

                                                                                                                                                            It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54

distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                    When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .\\n59

Australian, American and British English .\\n60

.\\n61

                                                                                                                                                                                                 In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\n63

turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

speech feature and 4 .\\n65

                                    Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n67

go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n69

.\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                              What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .\\n72

were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73

remote areas of ME .\\n74

problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76

directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

.\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointing given the prices .\\n31

great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

                                                          Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

        Should have been priced at $250  .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

                     Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n71

Amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .\\n72

                                                     Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the

be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32

blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                  The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41

so much easier than doing the same with a full size notebook or even the 700m .\\n6

not want it to do so .\\n8

and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .\\n10

                                        It's the perfect size and weight to take almost anywhere .\\n12

fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n13   It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n14

even smoother .\\n15

compressed size of the UP and DOWN arrows, but I suppose that was probably unavoidable .\\n32

sure you're ok with the size .\\n34

size .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                         although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n49

  and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .\\n51

fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n53

full size laptop or desktop .\\n54                                                                                                                                                      The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n56

the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n60

this product .\\n61

                                      It seems as though this is due to the small size of the unit, it doesn't have enough room to dissipate the heat .\\n63

professional life and she was using it for work, business discussions, document development etc .\\n65

to stick to the definition of  portable,  so this fit's the bill .\\n66

                                        Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of

                         I was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n70

the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n71                                                                                                                                             I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .\\n72

but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n73                                                                                                                                         As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n74

                       If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more

                                                    But with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, I'm getting a good

not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n27

week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .\\n30

only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .\\n32

me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

                                    Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                    you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51

image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n53

            I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

.\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\n58

                                                               I can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .\\n60

The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

                                           Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

                           The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93

have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94

                       Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

                           The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

                                                        But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                                   The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .\\n164

to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

I would never go back .\\n168                                                                                                                                                                                           Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .\\n70

solution, plus it doesn't drain the battery .\\n71

                           I left wireless on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .\\n73

is worth it .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                      I live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                   The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra \\u00a312 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76

kindle on the plane to Japan, and I could read for over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over .\\n78                                                                                                                                          The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .\\n79

                                                                                                                                                                               I just found out how to

They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .\\n5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

ever offered .\\n8                                                                                                                                 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                              I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .\\n19

                                                            Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23

                       It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25

Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46

the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\n47

7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52

have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

                                        UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n2

information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8

                I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36

smoother graphics on the 255w of the vehicle moving along displayed roads, where the 750's display was more of a  jerky  movement .\\n1

that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the

is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n16

City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It also can display and speak many languages .\\n19                                                                                                                                            I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The display is great, and is very clear .\\n21                                                                                                                                                      The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n23                                                                                                                                Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .\\n24                                                                                                                                                  The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have checked the display in three areas I am familiar with :\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                               But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                    I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The display is extremely legible both in bright sunlight and at night .\\n31   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Garmin has a nice 3d display .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .\\n41                                                                                                                  I really like the versatility of picking destination points either by inputing an explicit address, uploading from Google Maps, or just touching a point on the display .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The display is bright & clear in the car .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The display is laid out better than the 660 .\\n44                                                                                                                                     It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                   it should have the names of streets written down on the display roads as you pass them .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .\\n48

            the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33

        Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38

                                                                                                              So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case

                               In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

                                                                                                                         The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

                                                                                                                       Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81

                                                                                     The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

 I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought this car with

this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Great leg room in the back and the seats a very supportive .\\n37

font size that works best for me .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .\\n44

                                         1All the fonts look exactly the same, regardless of the book .\\n45

changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !\\n46

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I can still make out words with the use of strong glasses and setting the font to the largest possible on the Kindle2 .\\n49

grey colour background is relaxing, and its good to be able to change the size of the font .\\n50

font .\\n52

         Because of the ability to change the font size on the KINDLE she was able to once again start reading a book .\\n54

contrast issue which is exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .\\n55                                                                                                            However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                      I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .\\n58

newsprint, though you can change the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .\\n60

they're there .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .\\n26

XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

0 out of 5 stars XP speed & stability, Vista, like features without the headaches !\\n32

All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .\\n45                                                                                                                              Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46                                                                                                                                                          I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   All the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Does the new operating system have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Smooth OS with great little features .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                         A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I am not going to review the features, because there's plenty of that already .\\n60
